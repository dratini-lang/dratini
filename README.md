# The Dratini Programming Language

Dratini is a sister of the Python programming language designed to compile to native binaries üíù

## Foreword

Dratini (DraTINI) stands for Dragon Transpiler, Interpreter, and Native-code Infrastucture.
The word "dragon" is in the name as a direct reference to the fact that the Dratini language is meant to be far more powerful than Python at the cost of a slightly-differing API.
So far, there are no syntactical *(visual)* changes to the Dratini language as of yet.
This means that Dratini code is 100% identical to Python code at the moment.
However, this may potentially change in the future if the community collectively agrees on syntactical sugar valuable enough to the community to justify writing our own parser.

## Getting Started

If you follow the steps below, we'll have you up and running Dratini code in no time!

First, please download the project using either `git` or GitHub Desktop.

For GitHub Desktop users, clicking on the **(`<>` Code ‚Üì)** button in the top-right-ish of [the repository page](https://github.com/dratini-lang/dratini) *(likely the page you're reading this on)*.

For command-line `git` users, please run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dratini-lang/dratini.git
```

Next, you'll need to open the cloned project directory/folder.

Now that you've opened the folder, please run `install.py`.
This can be done by double-clicking on the file named `install.py`.

Congratulations!
You've installed the Dratini SDK (Software Development Kit)!

From here, I highly recommend visiting [our ever-growing collection of examples](https://github.com/dratini-lang/examples)!
